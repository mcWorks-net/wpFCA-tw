                            Playschool is for students ages 2-4. It’s a play-and-learn program without the pressure of formal schooling. Students learn communication skills, personal responsibility, real-life skills, creativity, music, and have nature experiences as they explore plants and trees… and even do some planting themselves! Basic numeracy and literacy is also integrated – learning phonetic sounds of the letters, and learning how to count and work with numbers.                    </p>

                            A child entering Pre-Kindergarten must meet the following requirements: This class incorporates basic learning with fun for toddlers. Nursery rhymes and children’s songs will form a large part of their learning, as well as watching educational videos, and learning Bible verses. We provide a loving, caring time for your toddlers. A school day for a student in this class is 2-3 hours. Focus is given to real-life skills that will prepare students for future success, and a hands-on approach is used in learning. Students will enjoy learning in many learning spaces, including simple mini-farms and gardens where they can learn responsibility and stewardship for the environment, and for animals. A child entering Nursery must be at least 3 years old upon enrollment. Finishing Nursery class does not automatically qualify a student to enter Pre-Kindergarten the next school year.
